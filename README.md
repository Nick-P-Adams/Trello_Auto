# Trello_Auto
## Description
Admittedly the structure of this app could be improved by miles. That being said I made this for a farm I was employed with as an experimental automation app. It would at specific time intervals usually once a day log into the companies trello board and move some cards around automatically. That way we did not have to rely on people's memories for updating the information. The way I implemented selenium web driver as the main way of interacting with the website using xpaths however meant the app needed constant updates and maintenance.
